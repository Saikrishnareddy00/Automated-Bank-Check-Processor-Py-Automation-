Real World Problem

Banks and financial institutions deal with thousands of cheques daily, and manual processing of cheque details like payee name, account number, IFSC code, amount, and date is both time-consuming and error-prone. Manual data entry also increases the chances of fraud, delays in cheque clearance, and operational inefficiency. Traditional OCR systems often struggle with handwriting, unclear prints, or low-quality scans, making automation difficult and unreliable in real-world cheque processing.

Our Solution

This project addresses the problem by combining Tesseract OCR with Google Gemini API to accurately extract cheque details from scanned images. Tesseract handles the raw text recognition, while Gemini refines the extracted text to ensure structured and meaningful outputs. The cleaned data is then stored in a MySQL database, making it easy to integrate with banking systems or financial software for further processing. This approach reduces manual effort, improves accuracy, and accelerates cheque verification and digital record-keeping.
