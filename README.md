Real World Problem

Banks and financial institutions deal with thousands of cheques daily, and manual processing of cheque details like payee name, account number, IFSC code, amount, and date is both time-consuming and error-prone. Manual data entry also increases the chances of fraud, delays in cheque clearance, and operational inefficiency. Traditional OCR systems often struggle with handwriting, unclear prints, or low-quality scans, making automation difficult and unreliable in real-world cheque processing.
